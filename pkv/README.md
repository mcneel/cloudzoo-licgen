# Partial Key Verification

Ported from delphi samples in [Brandon Staggs' 2007 blog post](https://www.brandonstaggs.com/2007/07/26/implementing-a-partial-serial-number-verification-system-in-delphi/). Adapted to use the hash of the serial number (a new GUID) as the seed for generating the license key.
